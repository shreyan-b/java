Program 6:  Title: “Write a Java Program to calculate area and perimeter of variety of shapes (circle and triangle)” Problem Description: Develop a JAVA program to create an abstract class Shape with abstract methods calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter(). Create subclasses Circle and Triangle that extend the Shape class and implement the respective methods to calculate the area and perimeter of each shape.  Method: Ensure that the program is well-structured, follows object-oriented principles, and provides clear and concise output demonstrating the functionality of each class and method.  Theory Reference: Module 3 Page no:157 Code: import java.util.Scanner; // Abstract class Shape abstract class Shape { // Abstract methods abstract double calculateArea(); abstract double calculatePerimeter(); } // Subclass Circle class Circle extends Shape { private double radius; // Constructor public Circle(double radius) { this.radius = radius; } // Implementation of abstract methods @Override double calculateArea() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
